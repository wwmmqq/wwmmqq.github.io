<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>
This is Wang Maoquan, a student at School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, East China Normal University. In my free time I try to learn something, go running and coding.
</p>
<p>
This website is about my experimentation in creating and following a system for constant personal growth by writing about my progress, ideas and rants about software development, programming and other things that interest me.
